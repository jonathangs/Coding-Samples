CampusPaths is a GUI-based program that displays the shortest path from any two buildings on the UW campus. 
The folder contains a .jar and all the other necessary files to run the program. 

FourHeap and HashTable are two examples of data structures I implemented in CSE332.
BoundariesParallel is an example of code I wrote for CSE332 that uses parallelism. 

Please e-mail me if you're an employer who would like to see all the source code from these (and other) projects.
